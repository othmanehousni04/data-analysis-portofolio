# Project 2: Statistical Analysis of Moroccan Tourism Habits

## Objective:
To analyze the motivations, choices, and loyalty of Moroccan consumers regarding tourist accommodation. The goal was to identify key factors influencing their booking decisions.

## Tools Used:
* SPSS
* Excel
* Survey Design
* Statistical Hypothesis Testing

## What I Did (My Process):
1.  **Data Collection:** Our team designed and distributed a survey to gather real-world data on consumer preferences.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Prep:** Prepared the raw survey data for analysis in SPSS.
3.  **Statistical Analysis:** Performed a full statistical analysis to find correlations and test hypotheses. This included:
    * Univariate and Bivariate analysis (cross-tabulations).
    * **Chi-Square (Khi-deux) Tests** to find relationships between qualitative variables (e.g., profession vs. accommodation type).
    * **Student's T-Tests** to compare the means of two groups (e.g., if gender impacts travel spending).
    * **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** to compare the means of multiple groups (e.g., if income level impacts travel spending).
4.  **Conclusion:** Drew actionable business insights from the statistical results, identifying that the modern Moroccan tourist is young, connected, and highly influenced by price, reviews, and security.
