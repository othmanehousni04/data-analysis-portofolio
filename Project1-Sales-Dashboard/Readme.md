# Project 1: Interactive Sales Dashboard

## Objective: To analyze 100 sales records to identify key business insights. This project involved data cleaning, analysis, and building an interactive dashboard.

## Tools Used: Microsoft Power BI

## What I Did (My Process): 1. **Loaded & Cleaned Data:** Imported the CSV into Power BI. Had to debug the data model by removing a duplicate, unneeded file. 2. **Created a "Smart" Column:** Used **DAX** (the IF function) to create a new "Performance Rating" column (A-Grade, B-Grade, C-Grade) based on profit. 3. **Built the Dashboard:** Created a fully interactive dashboard with 5 visuals (KPIs, Bar, Pie, Line) and 2 Slicers (Region, Performance Rating). 4. **Fixed Interactions:** Debugged the visual interactions to ensure all charts and slicers filter the entire dashboard correctly.

## Final Dashboard (Screenshot): (Here, you will upload a screenshot of your finished, beautiful dashboard)
